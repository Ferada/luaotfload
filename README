                         The luaotfload package

Luaotfload is an adaptation of the ConTeXt font loading system for Plain and
LaTeX. It allows OpenType fonts to be loaded with OpenType features accessible
through the XeTeX font syntax.

It may be loaded in Plain LuaTeX with "\input luaotfload.sty" and in LuaLaTeX
with "\usepackage{luaotfload}". LuaLaTeX users may be interested in the
fontspec package which provides a high-level interface to the functionality
provided by this package.

Please see the documentation luaotfload.pdf for more information.

This package is developed on <http://github.com/khaledhosny/luaotfload>.
Please report bugs at the Github address above.

Discussion of development for LuaLaTeX is held in the lualatex-dev mailing
list. See <http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/lualatex-dev> to join or to
